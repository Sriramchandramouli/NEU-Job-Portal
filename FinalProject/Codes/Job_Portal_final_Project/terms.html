                   All purchases made on the Client's Job Board will be handled by the Company's eCommerce portal. On the month anniversary of the site creation, a monthly statement is produced. Monies will be held in the Company's account and will be distributed to the Client when, following creation of the monthly statement, the Client's invoice is received.
The statement comprises:
The Plan cost
Additional costs for any 'overage'
Product revenue (i.e. revenue earned by the customer from job board users)
Job revenue retained as budget for network applications
Revenue earned from applications delivered to the network
Unspent network budget for jobs that expired this period
If the net result of the statement is
positive, then JobBoard.com owes the customer money. An invoice will be auto generated and a payment will be made to the customer by JobBoard.com.
negative, then the customer owes JobBoard.com money. An invoice and statement will be sent to the customer and payment will be taken.
There will be a total charge of £5 per month to the Client for Sterling eCommerce transactions. A fee of 4.5% will be applied to the gross of each transaction for transactions performed in all other currencies with a minimum charge of $5/€5 per month.
Client invoices will be paid within 30-days of the invoice creation date.
Whilst the Company make all endeavours to ensure fraudulent credit/debit card transactions are blocked from use on the Client's job board, any fraudulent credit/debit card transactions identified by the bank will be refunded without question (as per banking regulations), and the Client shall be liable for any bank fee.
